# GatewayName
# Default: openNDS
#
# GatewayName openNDS

# Option: GatewayInterface
# Default: br-lan
#
# Set GatewayInterface to the interface on your router that is to be managed by openNDS.
# The selected interface must be allocated an IPv4 address.
# Typically on OpenWrt it is br-lan for the wired and wireless lan combined in a bridge.
# On generic Linux though, it might be wlan0
#
GatewayInterface $WLAN_OPN
gatewayfqdn disable
gatewayport 8080


# Login Option
# Default: 1
# Integer value sent to PreAuth script as login mode
#
# opennds comes preconfigured for three basic modes of operation
#
# option set to 1 - Default Dynamic Click to Continue splash sequence
#
# option set to 2 - Username/Emailaddress Dynamic Login

# Use outdated libmicrohttpd (MHD)
# Default 0
# Warning, if set to 1, this may be unstable or fail entirely - it would be better to upgrade MHD.
# Use at your own risk
#
# If this option is set to 0 (default), NDS will terminate if MHD is earlier than 0.9.71
# If this option is set to 1, NDS will attempt to start and log an error.
